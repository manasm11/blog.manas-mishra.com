I tried multiple programming languages like C, C++, Java, Javascipt, Python. I was a python developer for a quite long time when I hit its performance issue. Then I came accross GoLang and have been developing in the same since then.

I wish to share my expiriences with you in this blog. I also have a youtube channel which you may find interesting. You may [visit my youtube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcTM2rFfJbXiqTqYL7ts8Ew)
