## Managing Your Life
### How Can I Stop Comparing Myself to Others?
Comparison emerges from two incorrect assumptions:
1. **World is a zero-sum game**: Zero-sum game is one where for one to win, others must loose. In real world, best deals are win-win.
2. **Ignore uniqueness of everyone**: Everyone has unique history which leads them to different futures.

Have clear definition of success, which is to grow each day.

### How Do I Build My Communication Skills?
- **Write**: Communication requires thoughts to be structured, which can be done through writing. So write daily.
- **Practice**: Record yourself speaking on any topic for atleast 1 min daily and listen to it, for 90 days.
- **Replicate**: Observe great speakers and try to replicate their style.
- **Read**: Reading enhances vocabulary.
- **Listen**: Listening is the hardest part of good communication. Listen patiently what others say.
